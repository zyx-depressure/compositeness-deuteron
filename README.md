# compositeness-deuteron

It is a calculation of compositeness of deuteron as a np bound state using Lippmann-Schwinger Equation.

The calculation is based on Jupyter Notebook.

The formalism is stated in T. Sekihara, T. Hyodo, and D. Jido, Comprehensive analysis of the wave function of a hadronic resonance and its compositeness, Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics 2015, 63D04 (2015). (https://doi.org/10.1093/ptep/ptv081)

The calculation is performed under natural unit. Branch cut is taken to be from the scattering threshold pointing to the negative direction of imaginary axis. Riemann sheet starts from number 0.
